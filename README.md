# TODO LIST

This is my first ever actual website that I made. I am going through the Travesy Media's JavaScript course in Udemy.

Here is the list of all the things that are possible as of now.

## Functionality

### As of now

1. Add todos
2. Mark them as complete
3. Mark them as incomplete
4. Delete them
5. Filtering
6. Clearing all tasks

### Future

1. Counting the number of items in each list
2. If the list is empty show some message instead of being empty
3. Storing and retrieving data (persisting data)
4. Proper sorting of tasks

## CSS Library

I have used [Skeleton](https://getskeleton.com/) boiler plate for CSS. This was my first ever experience with CSS libraries too. Skeleton really made it easy to just concentrate on what I have to learn right now (JS) and not focus more on the styling part.

## Footnotes

If you are following the same course then you would notice that this project is not at all similar to what Brad showed. He used Materialize. My approach is to try to do the same thing differently so that I understand the concepts better. I feel I can learn more by this, than doing the same thing he did.
